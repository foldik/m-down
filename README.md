# m-down

__m-down__ is a markdown processor. Seriously man? Why did you create another markdown processor? Most people people would ask...

Markdown is an extremely easy language. You can create amaizing documentations by using it's human readable formatting techniques.

Although the language is straightforward it is very limited in terms of the components that it supports.

I wanted to have a markdown processor which makes it very very easy to introduce new custom components and additional processing.

Let's say you have the following file and you would create extensions (very easily) for this processor to support your __csv-table__ and __chessboard__ components. It would be great. Wouldn't it? This is the main goal of this project.

```
# My awesome chess website

csv-table: toplist.csv

__Best Game__

chessboard: game_Player1_Player2.txt

__Best combination__

chessboard: game_Player1_Player2.txt | step: 35 white
```
